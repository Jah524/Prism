# Prism

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jah524/Prism.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jah524/Prism)

Prism is a handy neural network library for natural language processing written in pure Clojure.
This library get you a distributed representation of words.
Now prism is ready to work with following models.

- Word2Vec by skip-gram with negative-sampling
- RNNLM with negative-sampling

This library also includes some basic neural network model (e.g. feedforward, LSTM).
See demonstration section and [examples](/src/examples) for more detail.

## Usage

Add following dependency to your `project.clj`,

```
[jah524/prism "0.3.1"]
```

and you can find how to do with prism at [project wiki](https://github.com/Jah524/prism/wiki)


## Demonstration

### Feed Forward

- sin approximation with 3 hidden units

```
lein run -m  examples.feedforward.sin3
```

### LSTM

- with dense input

```
lein run -m examples.lstm.simple-prediction
```

- with sparse inputs

```
lein run -m examples.lstm.sparse
```
