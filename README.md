# Prism

Prism is a handy neural network library for natural language processing written in pure Clojure.
This library get you a distributed representation of words.
See demonstration section for more detail.
This library also includes some basic neural network model (e.g. feedforward, LSTM)

## Usage

Add following dependency to your `project.clj`.

```
fixme, wait a moment
```

## Demonstration

### Feed Forward

- sin approximation with 3 hidden units

`lein run -m  examples.feedforward.sin3`

### LSTM

- with dense input

`lein run -m examples.lstm.simple-prediction`

- with sparse inputs

`lein run -m examples.lstm.sparse`
